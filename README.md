geog3050/sjmansfield - Mansfield, Samuel

Hello! My name is Sam Mansfield, and this is my repository for GEOG:3050.
The purpose of this repository is to have all of my projects and assignments
that I completed for GEOG:3050 in the same spot. I am a graduating senior at 
the University of Iowa, earning a degree in Sustainability Sciences. I love the outdoors,
and enjoy activites such a snowboarding, hiking, skateboarding, and baseball (Go Cubs).
I grew up in Naperville, IL, and only moved once (to the same neighborhood).
In this repository you will also find my CV.
If you would like to contact me for any reason, my email is samuel-mansfield@uiowa.edu.
Thanks for reading!
